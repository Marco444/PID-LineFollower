# PID-LineFollower
This is a repo that anyone can to base upon to create/improve existing software of a Line Follower. 
The design is based on a ATmega328, although it is arduino so the different is not as great as it 
would be were it written on assembly/C. The robot this code was intended to uses 6 independent CNY70
as sensor and two motors controlled through an H bridge.
